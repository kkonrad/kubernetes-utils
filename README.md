# kubernetes-utils
Notes on various utilities for working with K8S.


## Alias

Can be added to your shell rc file
```sh
alias kc=kubectl
```
ex.

```sh
echo -e "\nalias kc=kubectl\n" >> ~/.zshrc
```

## Tools

### Kubectl plugins

#### TODO: Krew

[Krew](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/) is a plugin manager for kubectl


### Console

#### K9s

[K9s](https://k9scli.io/) works in terminal.
Used it only few times and it looked like early days for this product:

* hit some glitches
* got a little bit lost few times
* couldn't find some relevant info in documentation

In general looks promissing and I plan to get back to it in some time.


### GUI

#### TODO: K8S lens

[Lens](https://k8slens.dev/) claims to be Kubernetes IDE.

Havent used yet - TODO
